In the second part of the project there are 3 major tasks:

1) Represent images as graphs

2) Image segmentation with spectral clustering

3) Image segmentation with  normalized cuts (or n-cuts method) with recursive and non-recursive method

Each numbered demo demonstrates the numbered implementation. See the report for more information. 

*the demo picture called 'dip_hw_2.mat' is not included in the .zip according to sumbission guidelines. Make sure it is in your directory defore running
