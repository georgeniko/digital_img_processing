# digital_img_processing

This project was developed on MATLAB for course "Digital Image Processing" of Electrical & Computer Engineering (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki) for educational purposes. It is split in 3 parts. 
Each one includes a brief description of the assignment, the .m functions, the demo scripts as well as a pdf report (in Greek).

Part 1
In the first part of the project there are 4 main tasks:

1) reconstructure of 3-colour image (RGB) from a Bayer image

2) subsampling of the RGB image

3) quantization of luminance values ​​per channel

4) storing the quantized values ​​in binary format (PPM)

Each numbered demo demonstrates the numbered implementation. See the report for more information. 
 
*the demo picture called 'march.mat' is not included in the .zip according to sumbission guidelines. Make sure it is in your directory defore running
the demos, or change the filename to one of your choice. 


Part 2

In the second part of the project there are 3 major tasks:

1) Represent images as graphs

2) Image segmentation with spectral clustering

3) Image segmentation with  normalized cuts (or n-cuts method) with recursive and non-recursive method

Each numbered demo demonstrates the numbered implementation. See the report for more information. 

*the demo picture called 'dip_hw_2.mat' is not included in the .zip according to sumbission guidelines. Make sure it is in your directory defore running
the demos, or change the filename to one of your choice. 

Part 3

At the final part we examine the detection of salient keypoints by the SIFT algorithm. 

First, in demo 1 we will see the implementation of the Gaussian filter and the calculation of the space scales.

Next we will detect the requested points and we will discard some of them based on a luminance threshold.

Finally, we will see the presentation of the entire pipeline with other images, in order to confirm the operation of the algorithms. See the report for more information. 

*the demo picture called 'dip_hw_3.mat' is not included in the .zip according to sumbission guidelines. Make sure it is in your directory defore running
the demos, or change the filename to one of your choice.
