In the first part of the project there are 4 main tasks:

1) reconstructure of 3-colour image (RGB) from a Bayer image

2) subsampling of the RGB image

3) quantization of luminance values ​​per channel

4) storing the quantized values ​​in binary format (PPM)

Each numbered demo demonstrates the numbered implementation. See the report for more information.
