Part 3

At the final part we examine the detection of salient keypoints by the SIFT algorithm. 

First, in demo 1 we will see the implementation of the Gaussian filter and the calculation of the space scales.

Next we will detect the requested points and we will discard some of them based on a luminance threshold.

Finally, we will see the presentation of the entire pipeline with other images, in order to confirm the operation of the algorithms. See the report for more information. 

*the demo picture called 'dip_hw_3.mat' is not included in the .zip according to sumbission guidelines. Make sure it is in your directory defore running
the demos, or change the filename to one of your choice.
